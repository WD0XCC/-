CVE-2022-26659	2022-03-25	2023-02-01	7.1	0.04%			Docker Desktop installer on Windows in versions before 4.6.0 allows an attacker to overwrite any administrator writable files by creating a symlink in place of where the installer writes its log file. Starting from version 4.6.0, the Docker Desktop installer, when run elevated, will write its log files to a location not writable by non-administrator users.
CVE-2022-25365	2022-02-19	2022-06-03	7.8	0.04%			Docker Desktop before 4.5.1 on Windows allows attackers to move arbitrary files. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2022-23774.
CVE-2022-23774	2022-02-01	2022-02-04	5.3	0.12%			Docker Desktop before 4.4.4 on Windows allows attackers to move arbitrary files.
CVE-2021-45449	2022-01-12	2022-01-19	5.5	0.04%			Docker Desktop version 4.3.0 and 4.3.1 has a bug that may log sensitive information (access token or password) on the user's machine during login. This only affects users if they are on Docker Desktop 4.3.0, 4.3.1 and the user has logged in while on 4.3.0, 4.3.1. Gaining access to this data would require having access to the user’s local files.
CVE-2021-44719	2022-05-25	2022-06-09	8.4	0.05%			Docker Desktop 4.3.0 has Incorrect Access Control.
CVE-2021-41092	2021-10-04	2022-06-14	7.5	0.11%			Docker CLI is the command line interface for the docker container runtime. A bug was found in the Docker CLI where running `docker login my-private-registry.example.com` with a misconfigured configuration file (typically `~/.docker/config.json`) listing a `credsStore` or `credHelpers` that could not be executed would result in any provided credentials being sent to `registry-1.docker.io` rather than the intended private registry. This bug has been fixed in Docker CLI 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as possible. For users unable to update ensure that any configured credsStore or credHelpers entries in the configuration file reference an installed credential helper that is executable and on the PATH.
CVE-2021-37841	2021-08-12	2022-07-12	7.8	0.04%			Docker Desktop before 3.6.0 suffers from incorrect access control. If a low-privileged account is able to access the server running the Windows containers, it can lead to a full container compromise in both process isolation and Hyper-V isolation modes. This security issue leads an attacker with low privilege to read, write and possibly even execute code inside the containers.
CVE-2021-21285	2021-02-02	2022-10-25	6.5	0.55%			In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability in which pulling an intentionally malformed Docker image manifest crashes the dockerd daemon. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent the daemon from crashing.
CVE-2021-21284	2021-02-02	2022-04-29	6.8	0.05%			In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability involving the --userns-remap option in which access to remapped root allows privilege escalation to real root. When using "--userns-remap", if the root user in the remapped namespace has access to the host filesystem they can modify files under "/var/lib/docker/<remapping>" that cause writing files with extended privileges. Versions 20.10.3 and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent privilege escalation from remapped user.
CVE-2021-3162	2021-01-15	2022-07-12	7.8	0.04%			Docker Desktop Community before 2.5.0.0 on macOS mishandles certificate checking, leading to local privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-15360	2020-06-27	2022-07-12	7.8	0.04%			com.docker.vmnetd in Docker Desktop 2.3.0.3 allows privilege escalation because of a lack of client verification.
CVE-2020-14300	2020-07-13	2023-02-12	8.8	0.05%			The docker packages version docker-1.13.1-108.git4ef4b30.el7 as released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHBA-2020:0053 (https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2020:0053) included an incorrect version of runc that was missing multiple bug and security fixes. One of the fixes regressed in that update was the fix for CVE-2016-9962, that was previously corrected in the docker packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHSA-2017:0116 (https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:0116). The CVE-2020-14300 was assigned to this security regression and it is specific to the docker packages produced by Red Hat. The original issue - CVE-2016-9962 - could possibly allow a process inside container to compromise a process entering container namespace and execute arbitrary code outside of the container. This could lead to compromise of the container host or other containers running on the same container host. This issue only affects a single version of Docker, 1.13.1-108.git4ef4b30, shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Both earlier and later versions are not affected.
CVE-2020-14298	2020-07-13	2023-02-12	8.8	0.04%			The version of docker as released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras via RHBA-2020:0053 advisory included an incorrect version of runc missing the fix for CVE-2019-5736, which was previously fixed via RHSA-2019:0304. This issue could allow a malicious or compromised container to compromise the container host and other containers running on the same host. This issue only affects docker version 1.13.1-108.git4ef4b30.el7, shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Extras. Both earlier and later versions are not affected.
CVE-2020-13401	2020-06-02	2023-03-01	6.0	0.23%			An issue was discovered in Docker Engine before 19.03.11. An attacker in a container, with the CAP_NET_RAW capability, can craft IPv6 router advertisements, and consequently spoof external IPv6 hosts, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service.
CVE-2020-11492	2020-06-05	2022-07-12	7.8	0.04%			An issue was discovered in Docker Desktop through 2.2.0.5 on Windows. If a local attacker sets up their own named pipe prior to starting Docker with the same name, this attacker can intercept a connection attempt from Docker Service (which runs as SYSTEM), and then impersonate their privileges.
CVE-2020-10665	2020-03-18	2022-04-22	7.2	0.04%			Docker Desktop allows local privilege escalation to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM because it mishandles the collection of diagnostics with Administrator privileges, leading to arbitrary DACL permissions overwrites and arbitrary file writes. This affects Docker Desktop Enterprise before 2.1.0.9, Docker Desktop for Windows Stable before 2.2.0.4, and Docker Desktop for Windows Edge before 2.2.2.0.
CVE-2019-1020014	2019-07-29	2022-10-06	5.5	0.05%			docker-credential-helpers before 0.6.3 has a double free in the List functions.
CVE-2019-16884	2019-09-25	2023-03-27	7.5	0.32%			runc through 1.0.0-rc8, as used in Docker through 19.03.2-ce and other products, allows AppArmor restriction bypass because libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go incorrectly checks mount targets, and thus a malicious Docker image can mount over a /proc directory.
CVE-2019-15752	2019-08-28	2020-08-31	9.3	0.49%	2021-11-03	Yes	Docker Desktop Community Edition before 2.1.0.1 allows local users to gain privileges by placing a Trojan horse docker-credential-wincred.exe file in %PROGRAMDATA%\DockerDesktop\version-bin\ as a low-privilege user, and then waiting for an admin or service user to authenticate with Docker, restart Docker, or run 'docker login' to force the command.
CVE-2019-14271	2019-07-29	2022-04-18	9.8	1.60%			In Docker 19.03.x before 19.03.1 linked against the GNU C Library (aka glibc), code injection can occur when the nsswitch facility dynamically loads a library inside a chroot that contains the contents of the container.
CVE-2019-13509	2019-07-18	2019-08-27	7.5	4.20%			In Docker CE and EE before 18.09.8 (as well as Docker EE before 17.06.2-ee-23 and 18.x before 18.03.1-ee-10), Docker Engine in debug mode may sometimes add secrets to the debug log. This applies to a scenario where docker stack deploy is run to redeploy a stack that includes (non external) secrets. It potentially applies to other API users of the stack API if they resend the secret.
CVE-2019-13139	2019-08-22	2020-08-24	8.4	0.28%			In Docker before 18.09.4, an attacker who is capable of supplying or manipulating the build path for the "docker build" command would be able to gain command execution. An issue exists in the way "docker build" processes remote git URLs, and results in command injection into the underlying "git clone" command, leading to code execution in the context of the user executing the "docker build" command. This occurs because git ref can be misinterpreted as a flag.

CVE-2019-5736	2019-02-11	2024-02-02	9.3	0.44%		Yes	runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe.
CVE-2018-20699	2019-01-12	2019-03-14	4.9	0.11%			Docker Engine before 18.09 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (dockerd memory consumption) via a large integer in a --cpuset-mems or --cpuset-cpus value, related to daemon/daemon_unix.go, pkg/parsers/parsers.go, and pkg/sysinfo/sysinfo.go.
CVE-2018-15664	2019-05-23	2019-06-25	7.5	0.07%			In Docker through 18.06.1-ce-rc2, the API endpoints behind the 'docker cp' command are vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges, because daemon/archive.go does not do archive operations on a frozen filesystem (or from within a chroot).
CVE-2018-15514	2018-09-01	2018-11-09	8.8	4.51%			HandleRequestAsync in Docker for Windows before 18.06.0-ce-rc3-win68 (edge) and before 18.06.0-ce-win72 (stable) deserialized requests over the \\.\pipe\dockerBackend named pipe without verifying the validity of the deserialized .NET objects. This would allow a malicious user in the "docker-users" group (who may not otherwise have administrator access) to escalate to administrator privileges.
CVE-2018-10892	2018-07-06	2023-02-12	6.3	0.22%			The default OCI linux spec in oci/defaults{_linux}.go in Docker/Moby from 1.11 to current does not block /proc/acpi pathnames. The flaw allows an attacker to modify host's hardware like enabling/disabling bluetooth or turning up/down keyboard brightness.
CVE-2017-14992	2017-11-01	2017-11-22	6.5	0.14%			Lack of content verification in Docker-CE (Also known as Moby) versions 1.12.6-0, 1.10.3, 17.03.0, 17.03.1, 17.03.2, 17.06.0, 17.06.1, 17.06.2, 17.09.0, and earlier allows a remote attacker to cause a Denial of Service via a crafted image layer payload, aka gzip bombing.
CVE-2017-11468	2017-07-20	2023-01-20	7.5	0.48%			Docker Registry before 2.6.2 in Docker Distribution does not properly restrict the amount of content accepted from a user, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via the manifest endpoint.
CVE-2016-9962	2017-01-31	2018-10-09	6.4	0.07%			RunC allowed additional container processes via 'runc exec' to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.  This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC state before the process is fully placed inside the container.
CVE-2016-8867	2016-10-28	2017-07-28	7.5	0.16%			Docker Engine 1.12.2 enabled ambient capabilities with misconfigured capability policies. This allowed malicious images to bypass user permissions to access files within the container filesystem or mounted volumes.
CVE-2016-6595	2017-01-04	2024-03-21	6.5	0.48%			The SwarmKit toolkit 1.12.0 for Docker allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (prevention of cluster joins) via a long sequence of join and quit actions.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that this sequence is not "removing the state that is left by old nodes. At some point the manager obviously stops being able to accept new nodes, since it runs out of memory. Given that both for Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are *required* to provide a secret token (it's actually the only mode of operation), this means that no adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust manager resources. We can't do anything about a manager running out of memory and not being able to add new legitimate nodes to the system. This is merely a resource provisioning issue, and definitely not a CVE worthy vulnerability.
CVE-2016-3697	2016-06-01	2021-01-05	7.8	0.04%			libcontainer/user/user.go in runC before 0.1.0, as used in Docker before 1.11.2, improperly treats a numeric UID as a potential username, which allows local users to gain privileges via a numeric username in the password file in a container.
CVE-2015-9259	2018-03-31	2018-05-01	9.8	0.21%			In Docker Notary before 0.1, the checkRoot function in gotuf/client/client.go does not check expiry of root.json files, despite a comment stating that it does. Even if a user creates a new root.json file after a key compromise, an attacker can produce update files referring to an old root.json file.
CVE-2015-9258	2018-03-31	2018-05-01	7.5	0.09%			In Docker Notary before 0.1, gotuf/signed/verify.go has a Signature Algorithm Not Matched to Key vulnerability. Because an attacker controls the field specifying the signature algorithm, they might (for example) be able to forge a signature by forcing a misinterpretation of an RSA-PSS key as Ed25519 elliptic-curve data.
CVE-2015-3631	2015-05-18	2018-08-13	3.6	0.04%			Docker Engine before 1.6.1 allows local users to set arbitrary Linux Security Modules (LSM) and docker_t policies via an image that allows volumes to override files in /proc.
CVE-2015-3630	2015-05-18	2018-08-13	7.2	0.04%			Docker Engine before 1.6.1 uses weak permissions for (1) /proc/asound, (2) /proc/timer_stats, (3) /proc/latency_stats, and (4) /proc/fs, which allows local users to modify the host, obtain sensitive information, and perform protocol downgrade attacks via a crafted image.
CVE-2015-3629	2015-05-18	2024-02-02	7.8	0.04%			Libcontainer 1.6.0, as used in Docker Engine, allows local users to escape containerization ("mount namespace breakout") and write to arbitrary file on the host system via a symlink attack in an image when respawning a container.
CVE-2015-3627	2015-05-18	2018-08-13	7.2	0.04%			Libcontainer and Docker Engine before 1.6.1 opens the file-descriptor passed to the pid-1 process before performing the chroot, which allows local users to gain privileges via a symlink attack in an image.
CVE-2014-9358	2014-12-16	2018-10-09	6.4	0.27%			Docker before 1.3.3 does not properly validate image IDs, which allows remote attackers to conduct path traversal attacks and spoof repositories via a crafted image in a (1) "docker load" operation or (2) "registry communications."
CVE-2014-9357	2014-12-16	2018-10-09	10.0	1.43%			Docker 1.3.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges via a crafted (1) image or (2) build in a Dockerfile in an LZMA (.xz) archive, related to the chroot for archive extraction.
CVE-2014-9356	2019-12-02	2019-12-11	8.6	0.16%			Path traversal vulnerability in Docker before 1.3.3 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files and bypass a container protection mechanism via a full pathname in a symlink in an (1) image or (2) build in a Dockerfile.
CVE-2014-8179	2019-12-17	2023-02-13	7.5	0.19%			Docker Engine before 1.8.3 and CS Docker Engine before 1.6.2-CS7 does not properly validate and extract the manifest object from its JSON representation during a pull, which allows attackers to inject new attributes in a JSON object and bypass pull-by-digest validation.
CVE-2014-8178	2019-12-17	2023-02-13	5.5	0.10%			Docker Engine before 1.8.3 and CS Docker Engine before 1.6.2-CS7 do not use a globally unique identifier to store image layers, which makes it easier for attackers to poison the image cache via a crafted image in pull or push commands.
CVE-2014-6408	2014-12-12	2014-12-15	5.0	0.53%			Docker 1.3.0 through 1.3.1 allows remote attackers to modify the default run profile of image containers and possibly bypass the container by applying unspecified security options to an image.
CVE-2014-6407	2014-12-12	2014-12-15	7.5	8.94%			Docker before 1.3.2 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files and execute arbitrary code via a (1) symlink or (2) hard link attack in an image archive in a (a) pull or (b) load operation.
CVE-2014-5282	2018-02-06	2019-04-29	8.1	0.14%			Docker before 1.3 does not properly validate image IDs, which allows remote attackers to redirect to another image through the loading of untrusted images via 'docker load'.
CVE	Published	Last Update	Max CVSS Base Score	EPSS Score	CISA KEV Added	Public Exploit Exists	Summary
CVE-2014-5278	2020-02-07	2020-02-11	5.3	0.19%			A vulnerability exists in Docker before 1.2 via container names, which may collide with and override container IDs.
CVE-2014-5277	2014-11-17	2018-08-13	5.0	0.14%			Docker before 1.3.1 and docker-py before 0.5.3 fall back to HTTP when the HTTPS connection to the registry fails, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct downgrade attacks and obtain authentication and image data by leveraging a network position between the client and the registry to block HTTPS traffic.
CVE-2014-3499	2014-07-11	2023-02-13	7.2	0.04%			Docker 1.0.0 uses world-readable and world-writable permissions on the management socket, which allows local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
CVE-2014-0048	2020-01-02	2023-03-01	9.8	0.57%			An issue was found in Docker before 1.6.0. Some programs and scripts in Docker are downloaded via HTTP and then executed or used in unsafe ways.
CVE-2014-0047	2017-10-06	2017-10-13	7.8	0.04%			Docker before 1.5 allows local users to have unspecified impact via vectors involving unsafe /tmp usage.
